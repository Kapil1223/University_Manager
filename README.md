# University_Manager

This project includes Java and SQL. Java is used to design the GUI for the application by 
which the user can interact with software applications. The SQL Server is used to create the 
database in which different information will be stored. The main focus of this project is to give the 
best GUI for the users and provide many modules in a single product. Admin can view all of 
the information that is stored in the database through application and admin also can modify this 
information because the admin has full access to the system.
The teacher can view and modify their information as well as information related to students, 
teachers have limited access. The student can only modify their information and see, mark, 
and apply for leave. This project can adjust any additional module at any time.
